Specifically, given some partially filled ratings matrix $X\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$, we want to find feature matrices $U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times k}$ and $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times k}$ such that $UV^T = X$. In the case of movie recommendation, each row of $U$ could be features corresponding to a user, and each row of $V$ could be features corresponding to a movie, and so $u_i^Tv_j$ is the predicted rating of user $i$ on movie $j$. This forms the basis of our hypothesis function for collaborative filtering: \n", "\n", "$$h_\\theta(i,j) = u_i^T v_j$$\n", "\n", "In general, $X$ is only partially filled (and usually quite sparse), so we can indicate the non-presence of a rating with a 0.

The loss used for collaborative filtering is squared loss:\n", "\n", "$$\\ell(h_\\theta(i,j),X_{i,j}) = (h_\\theta(i,j) - X_{i,j})^2$$\n", "\n", "The last ingredient to collaborative filtering is to impose an $l_2$ weight penalty on the parameters, so our total loss is:\n", "\n", "$$\\sum_{i,j\\in S}\\ell(h_\\theta(i,j),X_{i,j}) + \\lambda_u ||U||_2^2 + \\lambda_v ||V||_2^2$$\n", "\n", "For this assignment, we'll let $\\lambda_u = \\lambda_v = \\lambda$. \n", "\n", "## MovieLens rating dataset\n", "To start off, let's get the MovieLens dataset.
