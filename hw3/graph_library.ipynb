    "In this problem, you're going to write a (very minimal) graph library, which uses both the adjacency dictionary and the sparse adjacency matrix representation of a graph.  Using these two representations, you'll implement two of the more well-known large-scale graph processing algorithms: Djisktra's algorithm for finding single-source shortest paths in the graph, and the PageRank algorithm for determining the importance of nodes in the network."

    "The graph we'll be focusing on for most of this assignment (and which we'll also be grading you on, we'll just be using a subset of the nodes that you won't know in advance), is a directed graph that represents the page links in the English language Wikipedia.  Specifically, we took the (pre-processed) Wikipedia dump from here: http://haselgrove.id.au/wikipedia.htm , which were taken from a 2008 version of Wikipedia, and we then selected only subselected only those nodes that had at least _500 incoming links_.  This resulted in a graph with about 24 thousands that had about 6 million edges between the nodes."

    "\n",
    "In this first part of the question: which will _not_ be graded (in the submitted version, you can't include the `networkx` library), you'll load the graph using `networkx` and compute shortest distances from a source node.  There are two files included with this notebook that are relevant here:\n",

    "The `.graph` file contains a list of integers, two per each line.  If the line \"`i j`\" appears in the file, this indicates a directed edge from node `i` to node `j`.  The `.nodes` file then contains a list of each node the the graph, where the link number indicates the node index.  This is how we can relate the node numbers in the `.graph` file to actual pages on Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Q0, load this graph into a networkx `DiGraph` object.  Note that the nodes in a networkx graph can be any hashable type (ints, strings, etc), so you can use any of these as a potential for the nodes (you could load loads corresponding to the integer indices from the `.graph` file, string versions of indices, or the node names themselves.  However you do it, though, you'll want to make sure that you can determine the actual Wikipedia page from the node number, and vice versa. (For what it's worth, we used the integer indices as node keys, and then created a separate dictionary that could look up the index from a node name).\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have loaded the graph, use the `nx.shortest_path_length()` function to get the link distance from the `Carnegie_Mellon_University` node to all other nodes in the network."

To be efficient, you'll also want to avoid explicitly forming the $E$ matrix, and should instead use the fact that $E = 11^T$ where $1$ denotes a vector of all ones.  Use the fact that we can reorder matrix multiplication if associative (i.e., the fact the $A(BC)$ = $(AB)C$) to make this operation as fast as possible.\n",
